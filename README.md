# DashLoader-Core
The framework for launching at the speed of light. Code and API are 100% version independant and might as well not be called a minecraft library. This manages registries and the serialization side of DashLoader.

DashLoader's performance is highly aided by the [YourKit Java Profiler](https://www.curseforge.com/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fwww.yourkit.com%252fjava%252fprofiler%252f) which helps us greatly with keeping standards high and load times low.
